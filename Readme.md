Semantic Textual Similarity

This is the project of the class Distributed Representations in Natural Language Processing at Courant Institute of Mathematical
Sciences, New York University. This project is related to Semantic Textual Similarity on the dataset and the scripts used from
the resource:
https://github.com/alvations/stasis

The models implemented are BILSTM in Chainer and the other method is Neural Tree Indexer Full Matching as mentioned in this paper:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04492

Additional sources needed:
For creating word embeddings:
https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Additionally I have also attached scripts for running it on NYU HPC Cluster:
submit.sh
mycode.sh
